### Review Questions: 

Week 1 and 2 was mainly review of history of telecommunications basic structure and system methodology, now is on networking/application layer.
### Tutorial Problem:

### Lab:

Part One

1. Is your browser running HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1? What version of HTTP is the server running?
My browser is running HTTP version 1.1 and the version of HTTP the server is running on is also 1.1.

2. What languages (if any) does your browser indicate that it can accept to the server?
It says it accepts in Hypertext transfer protocol, 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9\r\n' which is just English

3. What is the IP address of your computer? Of the gaia.cs.umass.edu server?
Computer = Src (source) = 172.19.120.134
Server = Dst (destination) = 128.119.245.12

4. What is the status code returned from the server to your browser?
"301 Moved Permanently" (originally because my browser was automatically upgrading http to https so i switched to private browser and got)
"200 OK" 

5. When was the HTML file that you are retrieving last modified at the server?
Tue, 28 Oct 2025, 05:59:01 GMT

6. How many bytes of content are being returned to your browser?
461 bytes were captured so 461 were returned.

7. By inspecting the raw data in the packet content window, do you see any headers within the data that are not displayed in the packet-listing window? If so, name one.
Yes, there are headers visible in the raw data that are not displayed in the packet-listing window. For example, the ETag header appears in the raw data but is not shown in the packet-listing summary.

Part Two:

8. Inspect the contents of the first HTTP GET request from your browser to the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE” line in the HTTP GET?
No in first one (that line appears in the third GET)

9. Inspect the contents of the server response. Did the server explicitly return the contents of the file? How can you tell?
Yes the server did explicitly return the contents of the file, I can tell when you go to the bottom the HTML data is there that mirrors the site.

10. Now inspect the contents of the second HTTP GET request from your browser to the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” line in the HTTP GET? If so, what information follows the “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” header?
I don't see it in the third but I do see it in the third GET request. The information that follows is the date it was last modified, which was Tue 28th Oct, and the line below is If-None-match.

11. What is the HTTP status code and phrase returned from the server in response to this second HTTP GET? Did the server explicitly return the contents of the file? Explain
"304 Not Modified" which just means the file hasn't changed so the server does not resend the file and uses the cached one instead.

Part Three:

12. How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send? Which packet number in the trace contains the GET message for the Bill or Rights?
There is two HTTP GET request messages sent. The packet number is 118.

13. Which packet number in the trace contains the status code and phrase associated with the response to the HTTP GET request?
No 126.

14. What is the status code and phrase in the response?
Status code is 200 and response is OK.

15. How many data-containing TCP segments were needed to carry the single HTTP response and the text of the Bill of Rights?
There are 2 reassembled TCP segments.

Part Four:

16. How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send? To which Internet addresses were these GET requests sent?
There were 4 HTTP GET messages they were sent to two different IP's. The one with the different IP was the cover_small.jpg.

17. Can you tell wheher your browser downloaded the two images serially, or whether they were downloaded from the two web sites in parallel? Explain.
They were downloaded parallel as they have different destinations, indicating they are from different websites to each other when they were downloaded

Part Five:

18. What is the server’s response (status code and phrase) in response to the initial HTTP GET message from your browser?
401 Unauthorized

19. When your browser’s sends the HTTP GET message for the second time, what new field is included in the HTTP GET message?
It says 200 OK after username and password were put in
