Core Variables: 
- Time = t
	- Starting time = t = 0
	- Time intervals 
- Position = x
	- Origin and positive direction: x = 0 ----> x+
- Displacement
	- Change of position over a time interval: Δx = xFinal - xInitial

Velocity and speed:
- Velocity 
	- Average velocity = length of time interval: (velocity)avg =  Δx/Δt
	- Direction is important for velocity not for speed.

Acceleration:
- Average acceleration = change in velocity over a time interval / length of the time interval: (acceleration)avg = Δv/Δt
- Signs same as velocity even though moving in negative means it just going in different direction.
